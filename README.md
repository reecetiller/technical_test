Reece Tiller Technical Test Project superhero api.

I created a simple application that pulls information about superheros and villians from the superhero api and enables users to login to an account create a team from a selection of heros and pit them against villians.
User information is stored in databases and users teams are remembered when they login in.

When starting the application if you go to the https://reecetillerproject.000webhostapp.com/Marvel/ url and sign up with an account you will then be able to use the application
